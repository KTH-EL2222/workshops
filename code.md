# Code
This is skeleton code for Arduino and Communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 

The code is written in c++ and Python. Basic knowledge of c++ and [python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) is needed for comfortable coding experince. 

During Workshop 1 you will only use 'Pi_Arduino' portion written in c++. It has skeleton code for Arduino. 

####Pi_Arduino
It includes skeleton for implemnting PID and Communication Protocol between Arduino and RaspberryPi(needed for Workshop 2).

'Pi_Arduino.ino' is the main file which includes declaration and initializations. Here objects to left and right motor are initialized from Motor class. Interrupts are attached for encoders. 

'motors.h' has the declarations of motor class, functions which need to be filled up for implementing PID. 

Communication between 
readSerialCmd() and 'raspberryCom.ino' establishes
