# Welcome to the EL2222!

The course is divided into two parts. The first workshop will introduce low-level control of the robot using the Arduino platform. For the second part, you will be programming high-level reasoning on the Raspberry Pi 3.

The goal of workshop 1 is to control motors by creating a closed loop control with encoder signal as feedback. The workshop consists of four assignments and one final task. In the assignments, you will get used to Arduino and the hardware you are going to use. For the final task, you will combine all hardware and design a closed loop controller with encoder signal as feedback.
