# Workshop 2

## Dictionary
* RPi = Raspberry Pi
* PWM = Pulse-width modulation
* CLI = Command-line interface

## Objective

This workshop is divided into three parts. In the first part you will get used to CLI (Command-line interface) on Raspberry Pi. In the second part you are going to explore OpenCV and use some inpuld functions to detect a circle. In the end of the workshop the communication between RPi and Arduino will be added. As a result you should end up with a differential robot that detect a circle and tries to follow it. 

For this lab you will need following equipment:
* Robot from previous workshop
* Raspberry Pi
* Raspberry Pi
* HDMI cable
* Screen
* Micro-SD card
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* 5V Micro-USB Power supply
