# Send command with RPi

Test this code <!-- TODO: change this to name of the code  --> to make sure that Arduino receives commands.

### Task
Design a control loop that makes your robot follow circle that we detect with OpenCV. By knowing that radius of the circle is constant, you can approximate distance to the circle by radius of the detected circle. Furthermore, the coordinates of the circle center are related to how circle is positioned with respect to the robot.

## Final task.
Make your robot follow a face. Checkout [this link]() to see how you can use OpenCV to detect faces.
