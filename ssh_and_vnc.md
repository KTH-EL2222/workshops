# SSH, VNC and remote files.

It is not always convenient having screen, mouse and keyboard connected to the raspberry pi. By using SSH or VNC you are able to gain control over the RPi over the local network. 

SHH can be used if only the command line interface is desired, the graphical interface of the RPi can be accessed with the VNC. It is also possible to do the coding on your laptop and transferring files to the RPi for testing. In that case SFTP or other means of file sharing can be deployed between the raspberry pi and your computer. 

Beneath you can find links to webpages that explains how to use SHH, VNC viewer or file sharing on different operating systems.

NOTE: vnc server should already be configured on the raspberry pi images you get.
